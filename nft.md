## What is an NFT? (Nerd Alert!)

Ethereum also allows for the creation of unique and indivisible tokens, called non-fungible tokens (NFTs).[79] Since tokens of this type are unique, they have been used to represent such things as collectibles, digital art, sports memorabilia, virtual real estate, and items within games.[80] The first NFT project, Etheria, a 3D map of tradable and customizable hexagonal tiles, was deployed to the network in October 2015 and demonstrated live at DEVCON1 in November of that year.[81] In 2021, Christie's sold a digital image with an NFT by Beeple for US$69.3 million, making him the third-most valuable living artist in terms of auction prices at the time, although observers have noted that both the buyer and seller had a vested interest in driving demand for the artist's work.[82][83] Land, buildings, and avatars in blockchain-based virtual worlds can also be bought and sold as NFTs, sometimes for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
